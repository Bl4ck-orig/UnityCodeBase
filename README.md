Common utilities for unity projects that I found to be useful in all my recent projects.

<hr>

In debugging is a DebugManager. By calling the DebugManagers Logging methods, output can be filtered and easily deactivated.

In the FSM folder is a generic state machine concept. It is very robust. Can also be found here <a href="https://github.com/Bl4ck-orig/GenericStateMachineHandler">Generic State Machine Handler</a>.

In GameManaging is a Gamemanager as statemachine that I found to be useful.

In Inputs is an InputManager class and instructions in order to use it via the new input system.

In ObjectSpawning is a class called ObjectSpawner, which simplifies spawning objects including ObjectPooling.

Saveing contains a SaveSystem Script which can easily save any serialized class.

SceneManagement organizes Scenes automatically. Create a Sceneclarification Object in each Scene, hit the "Bake Data To Build Settings" button on a sceneconfig asset, and the Sceneconfig class has every functionality you need for scenemangement.

And the Folder UI contains UI management classes.
